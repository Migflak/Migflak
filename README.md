## Hello everyone! 🖖🏽

I’m Migflak, a young man in his twenties who has been living in the 🌴 _Caribbean paradise_ 🌊 for many years. My parents decided to move here in search of a better quality of life, and this place became my home. 🏠

From an early age, my passion for video games 👾🎮 sparked a deep interest in technology—something that grew over time without me even realizing it. However, my dreams and goals were very different back then. After graduating from high school, I decided to take a leap of faith and pursue my biggest dream: becoming a pilot ✈️. But as time passed, that dream, along with others, started to feel more distant and difficult to achieve, forcing me to grow, adapt, and mature.

Facing reality, I decided to redefine my path and look for a career that would allow me to professionalize one of my greatest interests. That’s how I chose to study Software Development and Network Engineering, merging my love for technology with a profession full of possibilities.
